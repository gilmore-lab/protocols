# MOCO Noise Signal Study

## Short name: moco-noise-signal

### Description

This study evaluates SSVEPs to several different types of directional noise. The goal was to see whether there is some hidden directional signal due to a display artefact in the MOCO-3-Pattern set of studies. The study was started in response to a reviewer's remark that displays which have direction noise uniformly distributed on [0,180] have a weak direction signal.

### Participants

Two participants were run, both lab members.

### Display conditions

We used the standard radial motion paradigm (Condition 001) with a radial-out/incoherent/radial-in/incoherent global pattern at 2 deg/s. The noise setting was 180 (deg). Other conditions were as follows:

Radial direction, but a noise/noise modulation:

180/360

360/360

and the standard radial motion paradigm, but with 360 degree motion.

### Comment

In correspondence with PowerDiva's developer, Vladimir Vildavski, we learned that PowerDiva samples noise from a [-180,+180] directional distribution, thus giving no direction signal to the noise conditions.

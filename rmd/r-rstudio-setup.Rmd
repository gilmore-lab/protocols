# Set up R and RStudio

## On PSU TLT's RStudio Server (recommended)

1. What network are you on?
  - If on campus, make sure you are on the `psu` network. 

  - If you are using RStudio remotely (off campus) you need to install and connect to VPN **FIRST**.
      - VPN installation and connection instructions for [Windows](https://ithelp.ssri.psu.edu/penn-state-vpn) and [Mac](https://ithelp.ssri.psu.edu/penn-state-vpn-mac)  
  
2. Log in to R Studio
  - Go to: https://lat.tlt.psu.edu/home/remoteaccess/oss-web-apps/
    
  - Scroll down to the RStudio Server Section

  - Click on the blue box **Login to RStudio**
  
  
  * This link: https://rstudio.tlt.psu.edu/s/af233cfc78a318b9e0671/auth-sign-in may work instead of the above steps  
    
  - Use your PSU Access Account Username and Password to sign in to RStudio.

### How to Connect Github and RStudio on the TLT Server using a GitHub Access Token

#### Enter your email (used to log into R Studio) and username into RStudio

  - Navigate to the Terminal Tab in R Studio 
  - Type the following in to the Command line  

$ `git config --global user.email "user@psu.edu"`  
$ `git config --global user.name "First Last"`  

#### Each person needs to have their own or project branch

  - First request from the Lab Manager to create your own branch and provide the Name of the Branch (e.g. firstname_lastname).

  - The lab manager will create this branch on the Github repository site.

#### Enter your branch into the repository in Rstudio 

  - Navigate to the Terminal Tab in R Studio
  - Type the following in to the Command line: 

$ `git branch -m <branchName>` 

#### Create an Access Token in Git


  - Follow the [Create a Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) instructions. 

  - Be sure to copy this token into a safe place. If it is lost, one must be re-created. 

#### Clone a Git Repository to RSTudio on TLT Server 

  - Navigate to the GitHub project page (e.g. https://github.com/gilmore-lab/student-testbed) 
  - Press the button  `Code` 
  - Copy the HTTPS link of the project by clicking the little icon to the right of the URL. The link will be something like https://github.com/gilmore-lab/student-testbed.git 

  ![Clone with HTTPS](../protocols/imgs/GitHub-copy-repo-https.png){ width=50% }  
  - Copy this to another blank page. This will need to be altered to the following:
`https://oath2:<PersonalAccessToken>@github.com/<repository>/<project>`  

  - The `Personal Access Token` created in Git will be used in the above location.
`https://oath2:<PersonalAccessToken>@github.com/gilmore-lab/student` 

#### Make changes to branch on repository 

  - Ensure the branch name is listed in the Git window in R 

  ![Git Window in R](../protocols/imgs/Git-Window-R.png){ width=50% }  
  
  - Always run 'Git Pull' before changes are made 
  - Make Changes to File 
  - Commit changes 
  - Run 'Git Push' to Your Branch on Github 

  - Go to `github.com/gilmorelab/<repository name>` and create a Pull request 


- Notify the lab manager that a pull request is available on GitHub for `<repository name>` 

### How to  Access the Shared Space on R Studio  

- Go to the **File** menu and click on **Open Project**  
 
  ![Open Project](../protocols/imgs/ROpenProject.JPG){ width=50% }  

 
- Then you will see   
 
  ![My Projects](../protocols/imgs/RMyProjects.JPG){ width=50% }  
 
- Click on **Shared with Me**  
 
  ![Shared Projects](../protocols/imgs/RSharedProject.JPG){ width=50% }  
 
- Highlight the shared project you want to open and Click on **Open Project**   

### Configure RStudio for `git` integration

1. From within RStudio, open the `Tools` menu and select the `Global Options...` item.
2. Select the `Git/SVN` panel in the left column. It is near the bottom of the list.
3. Check the `Enable version control interface for RStudio projects` checkbox at the top of the window.
4. Click on the `View public key` link to see if you have a valid SSH RSA Key already. 
5. If the window opens and contains a long text string that begins with "ssh-rsa" and ends with "<your_PSU_id>@lxclusterapps", where `<your_PSU_id>` is your PSU ID (e.g., `rog1`), you are half-way home.
6. If the window is opens and is empty, you must generate a new key:
    - ~~Close the window and click on the `Create RSA Key...` button.~~
    - From RStudio, select the `Terminal` pane. This will bring up a command line with a prompt that looks something like this: `bash-4.2$`.
    - Type `ssh-keygen.py` and hit return. This will generate an SSH key.
    - Type `ls ~/.ssh` and hit return. You should see something that looks like this:
```
bash-4.2$ ls ~/.ssh
id_rsa  id_rsa.pub  known_hosts
```
    - The `id_rsa.pub` is a file containing a 'public' key that you can save on GitHub so that GitHub knows who you are when you connect to it from the PSU TLT RStudio server.
    - (Optional) type `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` to see the contents of this key file.
    - Select `Global Options...` from the RStudio `Tools` menu again.
    - Select `Git/SVN` from the left panel.
    - Select the `View public key` link to view the SSH key you just generated.
    - Copy the key to the clipboard (command+C on Mac)
8. Visit *your account* on GitHub. Rick's is at <https://github.com/rogilmore>.
9. Click on your avatar or photo in the upper right hand corner and select the `Settings` command.
10. From the list at left, select the `SSH and GPG keys` panel.
11. Look at the list of SSH keys.
12. If there are no SSH keys...
    - Press the `New SSH key` button.
    - Paste the key you generated in RStudio into the space provided.
    - Add a title like `PSU TLT` or `lxcluster`
    - Press the `Add SSH key` button to save the key.
13. If you see an existing key with `PSU TLT` or `lxcluster` you should already be ready to go.
14. Return to RStudio, hit `Apply` to save your changes, and `Ok` to exit the `Settings` panel.
15. Test the connection between RStudio and GitHub by cloning a repository.
    - Visit the lab protocols repository at <https://github.com/gilmore-lab/protocols>.
    - Click on the `Clone or download` button.
    - Confirm that the window title says `Clone with SSH`. If it does not, click on the `Use SSH` link on the upper right side.
    - Click on the clipboard icon to copy the `git@github.com...` link to the repository to your clipboard.
    - Switch back to RStudio.
    - Under the `File` menu, select the `New Project` option.
    - Select `Version Control`.
    - Select `Git` in the next window.
    - Paste the repository link you copies from GitHub into the `Repository URL` field.
    - Select a name for the local repository. I usually keep the name from GitHub, so in this case, I would use `protocols`.
    - Select a directory/folder where the repository will be copied to. I have an `rstudio/` folder I use for this. If you need to create a folder, you may do so.
    - Click on the `Create Project` button. This will copy the repository from GitHub to your personal (PASS) file space on PSU's servers.

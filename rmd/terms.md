# Gilmore Lab

## Lingo

120909*: A date number format Rick likes – YYMMDD – because it sorts nicely.

### A-G

*Virtual Private Network (VPN)*: A secured private network. Use the PSU VPN to connect with the wiki from off campus.

*Chandlee*: The PSU Building where the Social, Life, & Engineering Sciences Imaging Center SLEIC is located. The EEG lab is in 120 Chandlee. The MRI Suite is in the basement of Chandlee.

*Databrary*: An open data-sharing project Rick is working on with Karen Adolph at NYU. See Databrary.org. Related to the OpenSHAPA project. See also datavyu.org and labnanny.org

*ERP*: Event-related potential. Brain electrical activity generated in response to a sensory stimulus or a task (i.e., an "event"). Responses are averaged across trials into a waveform. Components of the waveform are referenced with respect to time after the event.

*Fourier Transform*: A mathematical technique for analyzing a signal (from the brain or otherwise) in terms of a sum of sine and cosine waves of different frequencies and phases. The algorithm FFT means Fast Fourier Transform. DFT means discrete Fourier transform.

*Fundamental frequency*: The primary frequency of modulation in some display. A response that corresponds to the rate of modulation is referred to as 1F1.

*GitHub*: Web-based repository for computer code. The lab shares code in the [github.com/gilmore-lab](http://github.com/gilmore-lab) repository.

### H-L

*Hammer*: Computer cluster maintained by Penn State's Research Computing Group. A Unix-based computer system for doing data analysis. We store our MRI and VEP data on hammer.

*High density*: EEG collected using the NetStation amplifier and the Hydrocel 128-channel nets from Electrical Geodesics, Inc or EGI. 

*HPC*: High Performance Computing Center at Penn State.

*ICIS*: International Conference on Infant Studies.

*Hoth*: Computer server maintained by SLEIC. It is a temporary storage place for data from the MRI scanner before data is transferred to Hammer.

*Low density*: EEG collected using a small number of Grass gold-cup electrodes and the Grass Amplifier.

### M-S

*MOCO*: Motion Coherence. Coherence refers to the proportion of dots moving in the same direction and speed. In the MOCO VEP studies, we vary the coherence from 0 (totally random) to some high level.

*MOFO*: Motion Form. Studies that examine brain responses to shapes defined my motion cues – differences in speed, direction, coherence, etc. Fesi et al. 2011 focused on MOFO.

*More Moore*: Gilmore's term for the new wing of Moore Building. Our lab has space in 459, 457, and 449.

*Motion contrast*: Regional differences of motion that allow the segmentation of a figure from background. Studies on motion contrast (as well as kinetic contours, kinetic boundaries, and motion segmentation) are all related to our MOFO experiments.

*MT, Area MT, hMT*: middle temporal area or its human (hMT) equivalent. Motion selective.

*MST*: middle superior temporal area. Optic flow sensitive area.

*Optic flow*: Motion patterns related to self-movement. When animals move forward in depth, they see their surroundings move past them in a radially expanding pattern. Eye and head movements contribute to rotational and translational (linear) motion patterns.

*PowerDiva*: The software we use to generate display and collect EEG data.

*SfN*: Society for Neuroscience. Professional society for neuroscientists.

*SLEIC*: Social, Life, & Engineering Sciences Imaging Center [imaging.psu.edu](http://www.imaging.psu.edu)

*SSVEP*: Steady-State VEP. Brain electrical activity generated in response to a visual stimulus with a specific, fixed temporal pattern or frequency.

*Smith-Kettlewell*: The Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute (SKERI).

### T-Z

*V1*: Primary visual cortex

*VEP*: Visual (or Visually-) Evoked Potentials. Brain electrical activity generated or evoked by some visual stimulus.

*VSS*: Vision Sciences Society. Meets in Florida in early May.

## PowerDiva terms ##

*Epoch*

Within NetStation, a period of time during which EEG was collected. 

Within PowerDiva, a sample of EEG data.

*Trial*

A period of time during which a set of defined stimulus parameters are presented to a participant. Typical trials are 5-15 s in length. Trial duration is defined by the number of stimulus cycles (or bins), the number of prelude bins, and the fundamental frequency (1F1).

*Bin*

A period of time/number of samples that consist of one or more cycles of a stimulus.

*Prelude bins*

Bins at the start or end of a trial

*Sample*

#Steady-State Evoked Potential Responses to Visual Stimulation in Children and Adults  

##This script is to be used when contacting families that are **NOT** a part of FIRSt Families Database.  

The goal of this conversation is to provide the potential participant’s parent(s) with study information, answer any questions they may have, collect prescreening information over the phone, and if they are eligible, schedule them for a lab visit.

“Hello, may name is {name of researcher} from the Brain Development Laboratory at Penn State. May I speak to {Mother’s Name} or {Father’s name}?”

- If parent confirms their presence continue with the script  
- If parent isn’t available say “I’ll call back at another time”  

IF PARENT IS HOME AND AVAILABLE TO SPEAK  
“How are you this evening? I am calling to follow up on the letter we sent recently about a study we are conducting in the brain development lab. In our study, we are investigating how the brain responds to visual information and how this response develops from infancy to adulthood. We are currently recruiting infants and children and I would like to know if you are interested in letting your child participate”  

  - If YES continue with the script  

  - If NO ask “Would you be interested in joining the FIRSt Families Database so that you can be contacted for future studies by other researchers at Penn State?”    
    - If YES or NO make note of this in the additional information column on the Excel spreadsheet  
    - If NO for FIRST Families say “Thank you for your time.”  

IF PARENT SAYS YES  
"The study focuses on how the brain responds to visual information and how brain responses change as children mature. We are testing children who are {age of children desired} in our lab on campus."  

  FOR EEG: "The testing involves recording the brain’s electrical responses while children watch changing images on a computer screen. This is done by placing a cap similar to a swim cap onto their head."  

"It would take about one hour in total and we would provide you with a thank you gift of $10 and a special “Junior Brain Scientist” certificate in appreciation. If you are interested, I would need more information about your child to determine if {he or she} is eligible for the study."    

IF PARENT EXPRESSES INTEREST  
“Is your child’s name {state child name}?  
“Is your child’s birthdate {state child date of birth}?  

“Was {child’s name} born prematurely or below normal birthweight?”  
“Did {child’s name} experience any serious medical problems at birth or shortly thereafter?”  
“Does {child’s name} have any serious health problems now?”  
“Does {child’s name} have any visual problems such as lazy eye or cataract?”  
“Has {child’s name} ever been suspected of having epilepsy, or had seizures when watching TV, movies, or a computer screen?”  
“Has {child’s name} ever had seizures when {he or she} was sick?” 

IF PARENT ANSWERS NO TO ALL QUESTIONS   
"Thank you. {child’s name} is eligible for our study. We have appointments available on {state next set of available appointments}. What would be most convenient for you?"  
    - Available EEG appointments are listed on the psubrainlab gmail calendar.   
    - Visits last 1-1.5 hours, when scheduling more than one visit per day, leave at least 30 minutes between appointments. 

- Once a timeslot is selected say “Your appointment is {day of the week}, {date},{time}”  

- Determine whether the parent will need childcare from our lab on the day of the visit: “Do you have other children that you will be bringing to the visit? If so, how many children and what are their ages?”  

- After confirmation, say “We would like to send you a map and directions to our center. Do you have an email address that we can send it to?"  

- Ask for a description of the parent’s car “What is the make, model, and color of your car?”  

- After you get the email ask “Would you be interested in joining the FIRSt Families Database so that you can be contacted for future studies by other researchers at Penn State?”  

  - If YES type **Wants to join FIRSt Families** in the notes column  
  - If NO type **Does not want to join FIRSt Families** in the notes column  

“That’s great. Let me tell you how to get to the lab and where we will meet you.”  

FOR STUDIES AT THE MOORE BUILDING  
“The lab is located in the Moore Building. We’re not far from the Nittany Lion Inn. Do you know where the Allen Street entrance is to campus off of Park Avenue? Moore is on Fischer Road, the first right after you turn on Allen from Park. Moore is the first tall building on your left. We’ll have a researcher meet you there and give you a parking pass for the Nittany Lion parking deck.”  

“Thank you for scheduling an appointment with us. We look forward to seeing you at the lab.”  

FOR STUDIES AT SLEIC  
“The lab is located in Chandlee Laboratory. We’re in the middle of campus, across Pollock Road from Old Main. Do you know where the Shortlidge Street entrance is to campus off of College Avenue? Take Shortledge until the T-intersection with Pollock Road. Turn left. Tell the Parking Attendant at the Kiosk that you are coming to Chandlee Lab for an appointment at the imaging center. We can have a researcher meet you there if your would like. We will give you a parking pass when you arrive at the SLEIC parking spaces.”  
(Researcher gives more instructions about how to meet parent).  
“Thank you for scheduling an appointment with us. We look forward to seeing you at the lab.”  

IF PARENT ANSWERS YES TO ONE OR MORE SCREENING QUESTIONS  
“We have very strict rules about who we can test, and I’m afraid that we can’t test {child’s name} at this time. Thank you very much for your time. Good-bye.”  

IF PARENT IS NOT INTERESTED IN THE STUDY  
“I understand. Thank you very much for your time. May I call you in the future about another study?”  

IF PARENT AGREES TO BE CONTACTED AGAIN  
“I will make a note in our files to contact you in the future. Thank you again. Good-bye.”   

IF PARENT DOES NOT WANT TO BE CONTACTED AGAIN  
"That’s fine. I will make a note in our files that you do not want to be contacted again. Thank you. Good-bye.”  

IF PARENT IS UNAVAILABLE TO SPEAK TO THE CALLER  
"I would like to call back at a more convenient time. When would be a good time to call? (Parent answers). Very good, I will make a note and have someone call you back then. Thank you. Good-bye."

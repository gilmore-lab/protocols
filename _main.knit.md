# About

<img src="imgs/GilmoreLabLogo.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />



This document is the go-to "how-to" manual for the Gilmore Lab.
It is where we document every imaginable procedure and task so that future lab members can get up-to-speed quickly and efficiently.

The document is a group effort.
It is revised and updated often.

## The authors

*Rick Gilmore* is Professor of Psychology at Penn State. He directs the lab.

*Andrea Seisler* is the lab manager. She also serves as the Authorizations Support Specialist for [Databrary](https://databrary.org). Andrea compiled much of the information in the first version of this protocol document.

# Trainings

## IRB training

At Penn State, research is governed by an [Institutional Review Board (IRB)](https://www.research.psu.edu/irb).

All faculty, staff, and students who conduct research need to undergo training from the IRB.
There are different training programs for different types of research, e.g., research with human participants or with non-human animals.

In this lab, all students and staff must complete training in the ethics of conducting research with human participants.

### CITI Training {-}

The [Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI Program)](https://about.citiprogram.org). provides training modules for researchers.

For Access, go to [CITI training](http://citi.psu.edu/).

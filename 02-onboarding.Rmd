# Onboarding

The lab uses a number of tools.
This section describes them.

## Asana {-}

[Asana](https://asana.com/) is used for task management in the lab.

```{r, out.width="80%", echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/asana-01.png")
```


Sign up for an account

  - Go to the [Log in page](https://app.asana.com/-/login) 
  - Pick `Sign Up` at the bottom of the window

```{r, out.width="80%", echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/asana-02.png")
```

  - `Email` the lab manager with your name associated email address so they may add you to the Gilmore Lab space

## Discord {-} 

Please accept the invitation to our server 'Gilmore Lab': 

You may be asked to create your account first. If so, follow these steps:

- Open your web browser and [register](https://discordapp.com/register) for a Discord Account. 
- Fill out the information including your email address, username, and password. - Once you fill out the required information, click on `Continue`. 
- You have now successfully created your Discord Account. 
- You need to verify your email address before you can fully use your Discord account.
- Go to your email and open the email from Discord. 
- Click on `Verify Email` box to verify your email account.

## DataCamp {-}

[DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) is used for learning the basics in R

- The Lab Manager will send an invitation to your PSU email address to join DataCamp.

- Please check your PSU email and accept the invitation email to the *Psych 494 Research Studies Class*

- If you do not already have an account on DataCamp, please create one.
  - go to [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/)
  - enter your PSU email address and create a password

## Google Calendar {-}

[Create a Google calendar](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37095#) including anything that you have on a regular basis (e.g. classes/weekly meetings)

Things you need to know:

- You will need to make each class in your schedule a [recurring event](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37115?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en) so it propagates for the whole semester.

- Share this calendar with the lab email with `See all event details`

```{r, out.width="100%", echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/google-calendar_01.png")
```

After the lab manager receives all calendars for the semester, the weekly meeting time will be determined. This meeting time will then be sent out via a google calendar invitation.

## GitHub {-}

Please accept the invitation email the lab manager sent to your PSU email account to be added to our Git Repository. I believe you will be asked to create a username, enter your email and create a password at this time.

## RStudio {-}

### On the web {-}

## Connect RStudio to Git/GitHub {-}

[HappyGit and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/index.html) is the BEST instruction manual with ALL of the nitty gritty details! However I am going to provide a short version with some more screenshots here.

The general steps are:
- download R
- download RStudio
- download Git
- connect RStudio and Git/GitHub

## Mac {-}

### Download R {-}

```{r, out.width="100%", echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/R-RStudio-install.png")
```

### Download R Studio {-}

### Download Git {-}

## Windows {-}

### Download R {-}

Go to https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/

Click the button for `DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL R`

This should take you to https://cloud.r-project.org/

Click on the link `Download R for Windows`

```{r, out.width="100%", echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/RforWindows.jpg")
```

Click on the link `install R for the first time`

```{r, out.width="100%", echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/R-RStudio-install.png")
```

Click on the link `Download R-4.2.3 for Windows` (or whatever is the most recent version of R listed)

```{r, out.width="100%", echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/RdownloadWin.jpg")
```

Then open the downloaded .exe file to install

```{r, out.width="100%", echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/InstallVerR.jpg")
```

Choose `Next` to install into the default folder

```{r, out.width="100%", echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/InstallR1.jpg")
```

### Download R Studio {-}

Go to https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/

Click the button for `DOWNLOAD RSTUDIO DESKTOP FOR WINDOWS`
(I think this button changes based upon the computer you are on - check on Mac)


Click on the downloaded .exe file to begin installing RStudio

(I don't have screenshots of this process for windows)

### Download Git {-}

There are 15 different screens during the installation process for Windows. 

### Connect RStudio and GitHub {-}

# Trainings

## IRB training

At Penn State, research is governed by an [Institutional Review Board (IRB)](https://www.research.psu.edu/irb).

All faculty, staff, and students who conduct research need to undergo training from the IRB.
There are different training programs for different types of research, e.g., research with human participants or with non-human animals.

In this lab, all students and staff must complete training in the ethics of conducting research with human participants.

### CITI Training {-}

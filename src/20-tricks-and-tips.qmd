# Tricks and tips

## Learning resources {-}

### R Markdown {-}

One of the authors of the `bookdown` package that we are using to make this manual wrote a book about R Markdown: <https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/>.
It's a great resource, and it gets updated regularly unlike the printed book.

## Naming things {-}

## `knitr` {-}

`knitr` is one of the engines that turns RMarkdown into HTML, PDF, and other outputs.
By engine we mean it's an R package.
The package also let's us create 'chunks' of R code.

### Use chunk formatting {-}

```
This will appear in 'chunk' formatting.
```

### Make code chunk with `{r}` formatting {-}

Here is how to make a code chunk appear with the formatting you need to type it into an R Markdown document.

To see what this looks like in the R Markdown document, you have to view the code.

````
`r ''````{r, out.width="100%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Fig 1"}
knitr::include_graphics("path/to/img_file")
```
````

### Embed a video {-}

````
`r ''````{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Data Sharing and Management Snafu in 3 Short Acts: https://youtu.be/66oNv_DJuPc"}
knitr::include_url("https://www.youtube.com/embed/66oNv_DJuPc")
```
````

And here is how that will look in the document.
I've added `echo=FALSE` to the knitr parameters so that the chunk itself doesn't appear.


```{=html}
<iframe width="780" height="500" src="https://youtu.be/66oNv_DJuPc" title="Data Sharing and Management Snafu in 3 Short Acts: https://youtu.be/66oNv_DJuPc"></iframe>
```

It's good practice to put the URL to the video in the figure caption.
That way if the embedding fails, you have a fallback.
Also, it's good academic practice to site all sources.

Notice that the URL for the embedded video is slightly different from the video's landing page.
The landing page URL has `https://youtu.be/66oNv_DJuPc` while the embedded video has `https://www.youtube.com/embed/66oNv_DJuPc`.
The video's identifier (`66oNv_DJuPc`) is the same in both.

The lab uses a number of tools.
This section describes them.

## DataCamp {-}

[DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) is used for learning the basics in R

- The Lab Manager will send an invitation to your PSU email address to join DataCamp.

- Please check your PSU email and accept the invitation email to the *Psych 494 Research Studies Class*

- If you do not already have an account on DataCamp, please create one.
  - go to [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/)
  - enter your PSU email address and create a password

## Google Calendar {-}

[Create a Google calendar](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37095#) including anything that you have on a regular basis (e.g. classes/weekly meetings)

Things you need to know:

- You will need to make each class in your schedule a [recurring event](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37115?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en) so it propagates for the whole semester.

- Share this calendar with the lab email with `See all event details`

![Calendar](include/img/google-calendar_01.png)

After the lab manager receives all calendars for the semester, the weekly meeting time will be determined. This meeting time will then be sent out via a google calendar invitation.

## GitHub {-}

Please accept the invitation email the lab manager sent to your PSU email account to be added to our Git Repository. I believe you will be asked to create a username, enter your email and create a password at this time.

## RStudio {-}

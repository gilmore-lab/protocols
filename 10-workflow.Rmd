## Package dependencies

There are many R packages that make writing documents like this especially easy.
These must be installed in your system.

```
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

## R Markdown conventions

### `bookdown`

- To omit the automatic numbering, add ` {-}` to the end of the line for each header--e.g., lines that start with one or more hash `#` characters.

```
# Top-level header without numbers {-}

## Second-level header without numbers {-}
```

## `knitr`

## Inserting images

To insert an image, you will need to insert an R code chunk (opt+command+I on MacOS; alt+ctrl+I on Windows).

````
`r ''````{r, out.width="100%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="This is a great figure from Seisler et al. 2023."}
knitr::insert_graphics("path/to/img_file")
```

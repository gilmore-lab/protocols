# Workflow

## Rmarkdown conventions

### `bookdown`

- To omit the automatic numbering, add ` {-}` to the end of the line for each header--e.g., lines that start with one or more hash `#` characters.


## `knitr`

## How to insert an image

```{r echo=TRUE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/GilmoreLabLogo.png")
```

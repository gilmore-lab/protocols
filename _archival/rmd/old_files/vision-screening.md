# Vision Screening

## Teller Acuity (infant)
- Keep the cards in order but turn some of them so the image is not all on the same side.
- Show the cards at 55cm away from the infant. 
  - If this is not possible show the cards at 84 cm from the infant
  - log the distance away from the participant
  - note the acuity for the participant in the [vep_session_log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ag6j1ZugcmysdEVEaDZ0WjNueVNXSmZrdkFWS1lzYXc#gid=0) on the psubrainlab google drive

Hello, my name is [your name] from the Brain Development Lab at Penn State. I am calling to follow up on the letter we sent recently. We are conducting an 1 hour research study where we will observe how the brain responds to visual information [using EEG]. If you are interested in learning more about having your child [name of infant/child] participate, please contact the lab at 814-863-3116. I look forward to hearing from you. Have a great day!

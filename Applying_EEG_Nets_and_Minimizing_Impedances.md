# Applying EEG Nets and Minimizing Impedances

## Researcher Preparation

- Make sure hands are clean and cut free.  
- Remove all watches and jewelry, etc., from your hands. 
- Put on sterile gloves.  You **must** be wearing gloves before touching the participant.

## Participant Preparation

- Ensure that hair is clean, dry and free of any hair products, including no-rinse conditioners, non permanent hair dye, hair extensions that cannot be removed.  
- Participants with cornrows, dreadlocks, non-permanent hair dye, non-removable hair extensions may not participate.  
- It is preferred that participants wear glasses instead of contacts.  If they wear glasses, be sure that they take them off for the net placement procedure.  The glasses may be put back on after net placement is complete.  
- Have the subject wash their face in 120A and remove all facial jewelry, including earrings, before having the net applied.  

## Head Measurement 

### Measure Circumference
- Put the measuring tape around the head starting and ending at the glabella (brow ridge between the eyebrows), running the tape over the inion (occipital protuberance at the back of the head). 
- Always measure in cm. 

### Choose Net
- Make sure to mark down which net you are using in the net log. Since there are multiple nets for all sizes, please check the net logs **BEFORE** choosing a net to ensure that all nets are used evenly (i.e. don’t use the same medium net that was used yesterday unless all of the medium nets were used).  
- Soak the net in fresh electrolyte solution for 5 minutes while you take the rest of the measurements.  
    
### Mark Vertex
- Find and mark the central point on the subject’s scalp:  
  **Do NOT Mark the scalp of an infant** 
  - Stand behind the subject and measure from nasion (indented area where the bridge of the nose meets the skull) to inion (bony protuberance at the back of the head), divide in half and make a mark on both sides of the tape with a china marker, perpendicular to the tape.  
  - Measure from each preauricular point (indented area in front of each ear flap where the jaw meets the skull), divide in half and make a mark on both sides of the tape (perpendicular to the tape) with a china marker, making sure the measuring tape crosses on top of the previous mark (this will create a cross on the subjects head, which is their Cz point). If the mandibular joint is hard to find, use symmetrical points on side of head.  

### Towels
- Drape 1 towel over the participants' shoulders
- Hand 1 towel to the participant
- Use 1 towel to set the net on after it is 

### Apply and Adjust the Net

#### The Short Version
**V**ery **B**ig **E**lephants **E**at **M**arshmallows  
  - Chin Strap (Blue Beads)
  - **V**ertex
  - **B**row Ridge
  - **E**ars
  - **E**yes
  - **M**astoids   
  
- Adjust straps between each step  
  
#### The Detailed Version
- As you get the net ready for application, remember to keep your hands and elbows in to minimize stretching.  
- Place hands into the net, keeping chin strap in front of the hands with the right thumb between electrodes 25 and 32 and the left thumb between electrodes 8 and 1. Put your pinky fingers on the outside of the two red electrodes in the bottom, back row (94 and 120). Grab the Cz with 2 fingers, or extend your fingers upwards to spread out the top of the net so the Cz is visible. Stand directly in front of the subject and keep feet squared and together, tell subject to close their eyes, and pull the net straight down on their head, keeping thumbs and pinkies in.  Use a rocking motion as you slide the net on and keep hands pressed firmly against subject’s face to ensure a tight fit. Remove pinkies and thumbs only when the net is fully extended down onto the head.  
- Tighten the chin strap (blue beads). 
- Check the position of the Cz (if the Cz is on the mark, pull the blue beads tighter). The Cz should be within 1 centimeter of the mark. if it’s not, remove the net and reapply. Keep in mind the chin strap needs to be far enough back so the subject can place their chin on the chin rest (if you are using one).  
- Adjust the ears by grabbing and moving groups of electrodes with both hands. If you’re working in pairs it’s easiest to have each person work on one side. You can also ask the subject if the net feels comfortable around the ears. Once you are satisfied with the ears, pull the white beads to tighten the net around the ears.  
- Check the Cz for any movement and tighten the chin strap (blue beads).  
- Adjust the electrodes on the face. #17 should be on the glabella, and the plastic tube should rest on the bridge of the nose. Slide the two eye field electrodes (#126 and 127) so they are in symmetrical places on the face (typically below the cheekbones), making sure that they do not block the subject’s line of vision. Pull on the red beads to secure the positioning of #126 and 127.  If you’re working in pairs, 1 person should make the adjustments on the net while the other person moves the electrodes under the hair to make better scalp contact and reduce the number of initial impedances.  
- Check the Cz for any movement and tighten the chin strap (blue beads).  
- Pull the elastic that comes from the blue beads and runs through the clamp on each side while opening the clamp on that side and holding both the white and red beads tight. Do this for each side. (**This is not the same as adjusting the chin strap.**) - Check mastoids behind ears (electrodes 100-RM and 57-LM).  To adjust; move electrodes up and over in small movements (being careful not to stretch elastimers between electrodes), and checking again for symmetry of mastoids from the top and back of the head.  After all adjustments, check the Cz and tighten the chin strap (blue beads).  
- Adjust all pedestals to make contact with the scalp (a pipette is effective at shifting hair). Then clip the net to the back of the subject’s shirt, check for any dirt and that pins are straight and lined up and connect the hydrostatic connector to the arm by turning to the right.   
  - Adjustment key:  
    - Red bead: primarily the eye fields and front of net  
    - White bead: ears and sides of net  
    - Blue beads: 
      - pulling both blue beads simultaneously will tighten entire net  
      - pulling one of the elastomers, one at a time, that stems from the blue beads, while pinching the clasp on the side will tighten the sides of the net and is good for picking up slack around the ears  

### Check Impedance

Run an impedance check once the net has been connected to the arm.  All impedances need to be below 50 before data collection can begin, unless otherwise specified.  To check impedance: go to “panels”, “impedance”, then “check impedance.”  Use the electrolyte solution with pipettes to rewet pedestals as needed for maximum conductance. Be sure to turn off the light after impedances have been checked.  Make sure to save and close once the impedances have been fixed.  

###	Run the experiment as the protocol dictates

### Remove the Net
- Unplug net and return arm to its resting position.  
- With gloves on, release the chin strap, ear, and eye field tension.  
- Pull the chin strap up and over the subject’s eyes and then pull the electrodes up and over the ears. Place thumbs in the same position that you used for net application, except rotate your thumbs so that your thumb nails are against the subject’s forehead. Use your other fingers and wrists to “walk” the net off the head by turning it inside out.  

### Clean Up

- Rinse the Net  
  - Rinse the net in distilled water 4 times, agitating for 30 seconds each time.
  
- Disinfect the net:  
  - Disinfect the net using 2 liters of the disinfection solution:  disinfectant is good for 2 weeks so check the date before using.  
  - Agitate the net in the solution for 3 minutes, then soak the net in the solution for an additional 7 minutes.  Do not put your bare hand in the disinfectant.  

- Disinfect the measuring spoons  
  - Wipe with a Clorox Wipe
  - Place measuring spoons on the towel to dry 
  
- Rinse the net  
  - Rinse the net in distilled water 4 times, agitating for 30 seconds each time.  
 
- Hang the net on one of the drying racks with the cord above it so no water gets on the connector and spread the net out some.  

- Log the net used in the appropriate red folder. Be sure to include any notes that are appropriate (i.e. any problems with the equipment, notes about a trainee or participant, etc.).  

- Be sure ALL WORK surfaces have been wiped down with Clorox wipes after you are done; including: both chairs, chin rest, keyboards, button box, all tables that were used and the counter in room 120A.

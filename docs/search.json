The package also let’s us create ‘chunks’ of R code.\n\nUse chunk formatting\nThis will appear in 'chunk' formatting.\n\n\nMake code chunk with {r} formatting\nHere is how to make a code chunk appear with the formatting you need to type it into an R Markdown document.\nTo see what this looks like in the R Markdown document, you have to view the code.\n`r ''```\n{r, out.width=\"100%\", fig.align=\"center\", fig.cap=\"Fig 1\"}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"path/to/img_file\")\n```\n\n\nEmbed a video\n{{r,&lt; video https://www.youtube.com/embed/66oNv_DJuPc\n    title=\"Data Sharing and Management Snafu in 3 Short Acts https://youtu.be/66oNv_DJuPc\" &gt;}}\nAnd here is how that will look in the document. I’ve added echo=FALSE to the knitr parameters so that the chunk itself doesn’t appear.\n\nIt’s good practice to put the URL to the video in the figure caption. That way if the embedding fails, you have a fallback. Also, it’s good academic practice to site all sources.\nNotice that the URL for the embedded video is slightly different from the video’s landing page. The landing page URL has https://youtu.be/66oNv_DJuPc while the embedded video has https://www.youtube.com/embed/66oNv_DJuPc.

Newer Intel Macs use NVRAM (non-volatile random–access memory) for the same purpose. Apple keeps things like the display resolution, volume, and startup disk location in this portion of your system memory. Resetting the PRAM or NVRAM can sometimes remedy strange bugs. Both PRAM and NVRAM are reset the same way.\nComplete the following steps:",

    "text": "Reset SMC\nThe SMC is the system management controller. Resetting the SMC is a similar operation to resetting the NVRAM. Apple recommends resetting it to fix issues with power, battery, fans, and other features.\nComplete the following steps for an iMac, Mac Pro, or Mac mini:\n\nShut Down Mac\nUnplug Power Cord and wait 15-20 seconds\nPlug in and wait 5 minutes\nStart Up Mac\n\nM1 Macs\nM1 Macs don’t need to have NVRAM cleared or the SMC rebooted. (SMC doesn’t exist on M1 Macs.) When an M1 Mac reboots, it runs a sequence to make sure the NVRAM is doing what it should do. This is the advantage of Apple making both the hardware and the software.",

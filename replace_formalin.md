# How to replace Formalin in Cadaver Brains

## Purchase Formalin

- Order 4L of [Formalin solution, neutral buffered, 10%](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sigma/ht501128?lang=en&region=US) from [Sigma Aldrich](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/united-states.html)

- Contact [Environmental Health and Safety](https://ehs.psu.edu/). In 2018, we worked with [Kevin Myers](klm146@psu.edu) to set up a time to use a hood in the Academic Projects building. 

- The procedure was to carefully dump the old liquid into a disposel bucket under the hood. Then replace it with the new Formalin.
